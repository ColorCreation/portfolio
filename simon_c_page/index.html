            <h2>Summary</h2>
	    <img class="artist" src="images/simon_c_page.jpg" alt="Simon C. Page">
            <p id="summary">After completing his education, Page joined a property company in a finance position and later got involved in programming and database development. There, he had to create corporate presentations that got him involved in graphic design. In 2007, he participated in a poster design competition that he won. Towards the end of 2009, Page learned that 2009 was the International Year of Astronomy and designed several posters as a personal project. When the International Year of Astronomy organization saw the posters, they contacted page to seek permission to use them. He granted the permission and the posters were used in promotional events.In 2011, he designed 10 posters for the International Year of Chemistry. These posters were later used by the International Year of Chemistry in an official capacity. Each of the posters was inspired by a prominent person in the field of chemistry. He designed a poster inspired by Marie Curie's work which was used to promote a screening of a film about her life. The International Year of Chemistry also offered the poster prints on their website. As of 2009, Page creates logos, designs and editorial illustrations for organisations and sells prints on his website. He has also worked on designing T-shirts. In May 2012 Simon created his first furniture designs with the launch of his Cuben Space Io Armchair and new wallpaper that was displayed at the International Contemporary Furniture Fare in 2012.</p>

                  <h3>His Work</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>I would keep it simple and describe my work as simply digital design and that I am a freelance digital designer. It’s easier with my parents as I show them a magazine illustration, a new print, a scarf or wallpaper on their iPad and they understand the end result of what I do for other people it isn’t as easy as that. I would go on to further explain that my work whether some class it as art, design or branding is all a way of me trying to make the world look and function better and hopefully excite people along the way.</p>

                  <h3>His Process</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>My work is forever changing and so my process is really about trying something different or expanding on something I have been doing. I love experimenting whether it creates a great piece or a terrible piece I’ve still learnt something valuable from it. A number of my more complex art is coded via processing which is an amazing tool and fits my style very well which as you said has become more digital and geometric of late.</p>
                    <p>My general process for creating my print work is to start with a sketch usually of a basic structure and from that I will then either apply it via processing or just go straight in to illustrator and simply experiment with the style and colours until I have ended up with something that I’m generally happy with. I will then leave it alone for a bit and then come back at it with fresh eyes to see if there is something missing. Generally speaking though, my best works are ones that I do in one sitting.</p>

                  <h3>His Methodology</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>I think they both have their merits but I am in the Jason Fried camp and feel that a more flexible work environment promotes more creativity than a stricter one. Most of the commissions I’ve been most proud of and which have had the most impact have been ones that I’ve been given free reign and find this always produces the most creative solution for me. Not to say that discipline isn’t important and timescales definitely have to be adhered to but too many constraints stifle creative processes.</p>

                  <h3>His Inspiration</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>My favourite book resource currently for inspiration is Graphis Annuals of which I have inadvertently started to collect. I like to look at what has been done before and see if I can do something different or take an idea and show it in a completely different light.</p>
                    <p>Some of my latest inspiration has come from Roger Dean and his amazing artwork and also old school math and astronomy text books which I find fascinating.</p>

                  <h3>His Flow</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>Music is without doubt the only way to getting me into my groove. This week Flume has been doing it for me last week Mike Oldfield.</p>

                  <h3>His Recent Projects</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>Something I am working on right now is some geometric styled glass which is going to be used in Virgin’s Atlantic clubhouses and hallways so look out for those if fly with Virgin.</p>
                    <p>And I have just finished a branding project for a new housing portal start-up, Whereabouts.</p>
                    <p>In the pipelines I have some new traditional wallpaper installations with flavorpaper with some multi-coloured tiled Cuben designs which are looking great.</p>
                    <p>Finally some new prints are coming to rareminimum.com. I have a new set of space prints which are a little bit different than anything I have done before, a bound leather A3 art book of 20 removable letter-pressed geometric prints and finally after months of work I am releasing my new range of silk scarves and pocket squares.</p>

                  <h3>His Unknown Projects</h3>
                  <div class="info">
                    <p>I’ve got a degree in applied mathematics that I don’t think many people know but wouldn’t be a big surprise to people who follow me and my work.</p>
                    <p>I’m a bit of a geek with Filemaker databases and I’m also a rather advanced with MS Excel and visual basic. Both of which are a great way of combining functionality with good design.</p>
                    <p>A final thing that people might not know, unless they have stayed in one, is that a large number of major hotels in New York have original artwork by me in their presidential suites.</p>
