	    <h1>Aquatic Life</h1>
		  <p>There are many sea creatures that are becoming endangered. Down below are some of the few species that we rescue and preserve.</p>
	    <h2>Fish</h2>
		<section class="profile"><img src="./images/java_stingaree.jpg" alt="Java Stingaree" height="220" class="flt_lft"/>
		  <h4>Java Stingaree</h4>
	    <p>The Java stingaree has an oval pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide; the leading margins are gently convex and converge at a blunt angle on the snout. The eyes are followed by larger, comma-shaped spiracles. The nostrils are crescent-like, and between them is a curtain of skin with a minutely fringed posterior margin. The mouth is bow-shaped, and contains three papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. The teeth are closely arranged with a quincunx pattern; each is small with a transverse ridge on the crown. The five pairs of gill slits are short.The pelvic fins are almost square, with rounded corners. The tail is shorter than the disc and bears a prominent dorsal finabout halfway along its length; immediately posterior to the dorsal fin is a serrated stinging spine. The tail ends in a leaf-shaped caudal fin, whose dorsal origin lies behind the ventral origin. The skin is devoid of dermal denticles, though there are tiny white bumps on the upper central portion of the disc. This species is dark brown above, with many indistinct darker and lighter spots, and pale below. The sole specimen measures 33 cm (13 in) long.</p></section>
		<section class="profile"><img src="./images/smalltooth_sawfish.jpg" alt="Smalltooth Sawfish" height="200" class="flt_lft"/>
		  <h4>Smalltooth Sawfish</h4>
		<p>The smalltooth sawfish reputedly reaches a total length of up to 7.6 m (25 ft), but this is likely an exaggeration and the largest confirmed size is 5.54 m (18.2 ft). It weighs up to 350 kg (770 lb). Its upperparts are brownish-gray, gray, bluish-gray or blackish, and the underparts are whitish. A sawfish’s saw is made up of thousands of sensory organs that allow them to detect and monitor the movements of other organisms by measuring the electric fields they emit. The sensory organs, also called ampullary pores, are packed most densely on the dorsal side of its beak. This allows the fish to create an image of the three-dimensional area above it, even in waters of low-visibility. The many teeth of a sawfish’s saw are not actually teeth at all, but rather special types of scales known a dermal denticles. These protruding weapons, combined with the animal’s ability to strike from side to side with great force, provide it with a powerful and efficient defense mechanism.</p></section>

		<h2>Mammals</h2>
		<section class="profile"><img src="./images/sea_lion.JPG" alt="Australian Sea Lion" height="124" class="flt_lft"/>
		  <h4>Australian Sea Lion</h4>
		<p>In Australian sea lions, as in many social mammals, mothers and their offspring can identify each other. Individual recognition produces mutual benefits by avoiding misdirected maternal care and therefore energy expenditure for mothers, and the risk of injury for young approaching unrelated, potentially dangerous, adult females. Individual recognition can be accomplished with a combination of several sensory modalities, including olfaction, vision, and audition. The use of olfactory cues as a close range recognition mechanism allows mothers to further confirm their pup’s identity.</p></section>
     	<section class="profile"><img src="./images/dolphin.jpg" alt="Hector's Dolphin" height="120" class="flt_lft"/>
     	  <h4>Hector's Dolphin</h4>
		<p>Hector's dolphins live in groups of two to eight individuals. They feed at the ocean surface and sea floor, with their diets including ahuru, yellow-eyed mullet, kahawai, arrow squid, herring, and red cod.Hector's dolphins are generalist feeders, with prey selection based on size rather than species. Typically, they feed on smaller prey which tend to measure under 10 cm. in length. Stomach contents of dissected dolphins have included surface-schooling fish, midwater fish, and squid, and a wide variety of benthic species.Natural predators of Hector’s dolphins include sharks and killer whales (orca).</p></section>
     	<section class="profile"><img src="./images/sea_otter.jpg" alt="Sea Otter" height="300" class="flt_lft"/>
     	  <h4>Sea Otter</h4>
		<p>Unlike most other marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its exceptionally thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 strands of hair per square centimeter (nearly one million per sq in), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. Sea otters spend much of their time grooming, which consists of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur. Although it can hold its breath for up to five minutes, its dives typically last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. The sea otter has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams.</p></section>

		<h2>Reptiles</h2>
     	<section class="profile"><img src="./images/burmese_star_tortoise.jpg" alt="Burmese Star Tortoise" height="60" class="flt_lft"/>
     	  <h4>Burmese Star Tortoise</h4>
		<p>The Burmese Star Tortoise has radiating star-shaped patterns on its strongly domed carapace. It has bumps on its shell that look like stars. This tortoise can easily be distinguished from the more common Indian star tortoise by comparing the plastrons of the two species.</p></section>
     	<section class="profile"><img src="./images/sahul_reef_snake.jpg" alt="Sahul Reef Snake" height="80" class="flt_lft"/>
     	  <h4>Sahul Reef Snake</h4>
		<p>They breathe at the surface, and close the nostril valves during dives which may last as much as two hours. They have only one lung, which is cylindrical and almost as long as the body. Oxygen is however also absorbed through their skin, which is shed more regularly than land snakes, to rid them from attached marine organisms.</p></section>
     	<section class="profile"><img src="./images/hawksbill_sea_turtle.jpg" alt="Hawksbill Sea Turtle" height="120" class="flt_lft"/>
     	  <h4>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h4>
		 <p>While they are omnivorous, sea sponges are their principal food; they constitute 70–95% of the turtles' diets in the Caribbean. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper. The hawksbill sea turtle has been shown to be biofluorescent and is the first reptile recorded with this characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral <em>Physogyra lichtensteini</em>.</p></section>
