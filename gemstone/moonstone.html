				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>Because of its connection to the moon, this stone rocks at soothing emotions during that time of 
				the month. The Moonstone crystal healing properties are the best stones for balancing hormones and 
				providing support during periods of hormonal change such as puberty or menopause.</p>
				
				<p>Wear Moonstone jewelry next to the heart on a necklace and always feel its glowing, magical energy 
				illuminating your aura and everything around you. Remember that whimsical abandon you had as a child? 
				It's time to steal it back under the glow the moonlight as you maintain the balance of innocence and 
				pleasure with a dash of empowerment and intrigue. If you're in the mood for romance, Moonstone is a 
				gem for adding some spice to your love life because it symbolizes the divine feminine energy at its 
				full potential, a dazzling site for the eyes and a miracle of life itself.</p>
				
				<p>Fall into the rhythm of nature and the constant give and take of daily existence. In other words, 
				let things happen naturally. Don't force life because that's just a form of resistance to the most 
				powerful healing medicine of them all – love in its purest form. When you share that love with your 
				partner, Moonstone reminds you to love openly and without judgment, because when you reach for the 
				moon and the stars, the universe will always catch you. Keep Moonstone in the boudoir and always 
				trust that it will guide your heart towards light and love, the medicine to heal the world. Like the 
				Apache proverb says, "May the sun bring you new energy by day, may the moon gently restore you by 
				night...and may you walk gently through the world, knowing its beauty all the days of your life."</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>The Moonstone Crystal stone meaning is linked with our ancient fascination with the moon, the 
				glowing Mandala of the sky. Call on the Moonstone crystal meaning to unlock the inner goddess that 
				exists deep within your spirit and channel the brilliant white illumination of moonbeams shining 
				light on your pathway to balance and harmony.</p>
				
				<p>Moonstone helps to open up the heart chakra, which allows us to be more receptive and in touch 
				with our inner feelings. Like waves crashing on the beach in a study push and pull of the tides, get 
				back into your own natural rhythm and discover hidden treasures deep within the self. Moonstone is a 
				creativity charm, and it rocks at bringing out your muse because it reminds you of the miracle of 
				life and our vast universe of infinite possibilities.</p>
