				center that anchors you securely to the earth. Armed with the power of now, take on the day with 
				renewed confidence when you wear Obsidian stone jewelry, a stylish way to have a constant flow of 
				its tough and resilient energy.</p>
				
				<p>In healing layouts, the Obsidian crystal brings a strong presence with its powerful grounding 
				properties. When your head is lost in the clouds, it can cause unwelcome side effects, including 
				procrastination and feelings of isolation. If you find yourself getting lost down the rabbit hole 
				of spirituality, the Obsidian crystal makes an excellent tonic for restoring a harmonious balance 
				between your spiritual self and the physical world of reality. Use the Obsidian properties to anchor 
				yourself securely into the earth, keeping your eyes on the stars and your feet planted firmly on the

				during a healing process, especially one that unfolds over time. It gives us the strength and 
				patience needed to overcome challenges, no matter how long the journey takes.</p>
				
				<p>Cheaper than a few sessions on a therapist's couch, create your own therapeutic session when you 
				meditate with the stone on a daily basis. Gaze at the stone in peaceful contemplation and ask it to 
				give you clarity and focus by bringing any negativity to the surface. Once it helps cut through 
				self-deception, you're on your way to encouraging the body's ancient blueprint for the healing 
				process.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>The Obsidian crystal stone meaning can be traced back to Paleolithic times where it was used to 
				make arrowheads and other tools. Cherished for its deep, glossy sheen, Obsidian is often called 
				volcanic glass because it is formed from molten lava that has cooled very quickly.</p>
				
				<p>With such a rich lineage, Obsidian has plenty of street cred, so every time you gaze at its at 
				shiny luster, let yourself be reminded of its reputation for being a powerful and protective 
				talisman. During prehistoric times, the Obsidian crystal wasn't just a stylish way to accessorize a 
				loincloth. This warrior stone also protected our Paleo-Indian ancestors from marauding invaders and 
				the perils of hunting.</p>
