				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>If your emotional forecast is partly cloudy and blocking your inner rays ofsunshine, call on the 
				Lapis Lazuli crystal properties and channel the soothing vibrations of its deep blue color, which 
				inspires images of the ocean, the sky, and the heavens. And when it comes to finding your happy place, 
				these life-giving elements make top destinations for calming the mind and opening the doors to a 
				higher consciousness. The Lapis Lazuli crystal allows you to keep your feet on the ground and your 
				head in the clouds.</p>
				
				<p>Treasured by the ancient Egyptians for its powerful ability to bring about insight and spiritual 
				transformation, the Lapis Lazuli crystal healing properties also have practical applications. A 
				natural alternative to aspirin, this stone is an excellent remedy for migraines and headaches, 
				especially since it stimulates the third eye chakra. Place on your forehead along with other healing 
				water stones like Turquoises and Sodalite, and inhale deeply while feeling its brilliant rays of 
				light infusing your body with healing energy. On the exhale, imagine all the bad energy being 
				released, like a river of tranquility flowing out towards the sea.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>Also used to decorate tombs of King Tutt and other famous pharaohs, the Lapis Lazuli crystal 
				stone meaning helps bridge the gap between the physical world and the spiritual realm that exists 
				beyond the horizon in a merging of the past and present. Take this stone out for a spin on your 
				spiritual journey and get ready to go deep within, the sacred place in your soul where you hide 
				your deepest desires. Take it even further by meditating with the crystal and expanding your mind 
				to a world where anything is possible, including conversing with ancestors from past lives.</p>
				
				<p>If you find yourself drawn to the Lapis Lazuli stone, it could be a sign that you're ready to 
				open the doors to the magic and wonder of the universe. Meditate with Lapis Lazuli crystal, a water 
				element stone, and discover the honesty of your spirit, both in the spoken and written word. To set 
				the mood for deep introspection and shamanistic journeying, prepare your space with a cleansing and 
				purification ritual. Borrowing from the Native American tradition used for thousands of years, 
				smudge your environment and crystals with sage to cleanse the energy fields of toxic energy. Like 
				any meditation practice, begin your therapeutic session by focusing on your breath and quieting the 
				mind. This is also a good time to take stock of your current state. If the hamster wheel is in 
				overdrive, focus your mind on the stone and ask it to bring serenity during times of chaos.</p>
				
				<p>Lapis Lazuli helps bring awareness of the soul and your spiritual purpose in life. For the 
				Egyptians it was the great pyramids. For you, it's whatever your heart desires. And although we may 
				walk different paths than our ancestors, our destinations are the same--to walk into the light of 
				divine purpose. In the words of philosopher Carl Jung, "Who looks outside dreams. Who looks inside 
				awakens." If you are drawn to the cool and soothing colors of this vibrant stone, it could be a sign 
				that you need help getting out of a spiritual funk. Climb out of the abyss with Lapis Lazuli crystal 
				properties and bring tranquility and spiritual renewal into your life.</p>
