				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>In crystal healing, people often say that the crystal chooses you instead of the other way around. 
				If the Amazonite crystal properties have found their way into your life, it's a sign that you're in 
				need of the truth, even if it hurts. The Amazonite crystal healing properties remind us that it's 
				time for our voices to be heard. A powerful throat chakra stone, the Amazonite healing properties 
				help you move beyond the fear of confrontation or judgment so you can freely pursue and express your 
				true self. The filters of society, like gender roles and cultural expectations, often cloud inner 
				truth, but Amazonite properties help guide you to a more genuine plane of existence. </p>
				
				<p>Meditation with the Amazonite crystal is the perfect time to take inventory of your current 
				mind-body-spirit. Gaze at the stone in peaceful contemplation and let it dissolve any negative 
				thoughts that come to the surface. Remember that there’s a reason you chose Amazonite. It's a clear 
				signal from the heavens that your healing process involves soothing old emotional wounds and 
				bolstering physical stamina needed to seize the day.</p> 
				
				<p>Besides its eye-catching aesthetic, the Amazonite crystal gives you the wisdom to recognize 
				compassion by energizing and supporting the heart chakra. This powerful stone gently infuses the 
				spirit with your truest intentions, liberating your soul from negative or confusing influences 
				trying to throw you off course. Life may seem overwhelming and bewildering at times, but the 
				Amazonite brings order to chaos with its pure light overflowing with love and hope.</p> 
				
				<p>The medicine of the Amazonite teaches us to love the truth of our inner selves, the only way to 
				truly know it. Meditate with Amazonite crystal and channel its infinitely wise message – sometimes 
				you have to lose your mind to find yourself.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>Known as the "hope" stone, the Amazonite crystal is an excellent manifestation tool, especially 
				when you incorporate its energy into daily meditation practice. To set up the best backdrop for a 
				healing transformation, retreat into a sacred space that has been cleansed and purified with a sage 
				stick. Then, instill your Amazonite crystal stone with a power affirmation and take on the world 
				with confidence with a spirited "can-do" attitude. "I can achieve anything I set my mind to do." 
				Say this mantra out loud and let the Amazonite crystal stone meaning work to magnify your intentions 
				and affirmations.</p>
				
				<p>Dating back to ancient times, the brilliant blue-green hue of the Amazonite crystal was a 
				distinguishing feature of the lavish and opulent emperor tombs of Egypt. Combined with Lapis Lazuli 
				and Carnelian, the famous gold mask of Pharaoh Tutankhamen is also decorated with Amazonite, 
				bringing the dazzling color of tropical waters to the sacred pyramids. Often regarded as a good 
				luck charm, it was also a distinctive element in jewelry design, particularly with ancient Indians, 
				who took advantage of its moderate hardness and carved it into round cabochon shapes for setting in 
				rings, pendants, and earrings.</p>
				
				<p>A modern take on this ancient relic stone, our Pure Energy bracelet set combines other powerful 
				cleansing and purifying stones, including Tourmalinated Quartz and Clear Quartz for a triple-dose 
				of its energy clearing properties. Add a pop of color to your wardrobe while keeping your aura 
				balanced and flowing smoothly, whatever your emotional forecast. </p>
