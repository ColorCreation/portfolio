				encourages us to step away from our daily electronic because the secrets of the universe aren't 
				going to be found on the Internet. But if you feed the soul with the spiritual nutrition of Fluorite, 
				you'll begin to trust your own creative process.</p>
				
				<p>Adulting can be hard, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed by daily responsibilities.

				creating a powerful but gentle healing effect that instantly releases tension and stress.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>

				colors when exposed to UV rays. An excellent stone for students, the Fluoride crystal works to boost 
				peacefulness and clear focus in your environment, making it a must-have for those times when you need

				of inspiration with the Fluorite crystal, your stepping-stone to better decision-making and enhanced 
				concentration.</p>
				
				<p>If you're facing big challenges ahead, summon the healing white light of Fluorite by sitting 
				quietly with the stone and giving it an intention. Follow your breath, inhaling peace and clarity 
				while exhaling confusion and chaos. Let your breathing slow to a natural pace and inhale the 
				peaceful vibes of the universe, exhaling turmoil and letting it all go with each breathe. Rinse and 
				repeat until you feel a deep relaxation that helps clear the fog of your mind. With a clear head, 
				fully experience all the intricate details of our beautiful world.</p>
