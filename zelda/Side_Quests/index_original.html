				</div>
				<p>There are seven hidden skills that can be learned in the game. The first one will be learned during the main quest, but the other skills will require that you seek out the Howling Stones. When you are in your wolf form, you must go near the Howling Stones and howl the tune coming from it. Once you have successfully played the tune, a wolf apparition will appear somewhere in Hyrule to teach you a one of the Hidden Skills.</p>
